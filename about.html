    <p class="drop-cap">Welcome to our slice of the World Wide Web! Open Source Life is a blog. We have a commitment that shapes all of our writings and that's to the oneness of existence. This means seeing the world as one family. More than ever, we believe this is an important message to share.</p>

    <p>Our roots are in Advaita Vedanta, composed of the sacred texts of the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. Fortunately, these texts point to that oneness. Through the grace of Swami Bodhananda and his dedicated life of study, these teachings were shared with us. This is what inspires our words.</p>

    <p>A part of this vision includes viewing the world as a flowering of and non-separate from spirit. With technology playing a big role in our lives, we feel it can be used for common good. By building this site on the <a href="https://github.com/chityhi/open-source-life">open source platform</a>, we hope to inspire a generation that views coding, or any creative outlet, as an expression of our innate nature—happiness.</p>
